Extension
----------

In the base paper, the author mentioned to use NTHU-DDD and YAWDD dataset for analysis with different models like ALexNet, ResNet, VGG, MCNN, Random Forest, Naive BAyes, KNN and AdaBoost, in which MCNN got 98% of accuracy 
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other techniques such as DenseNet and Xception along with that ensemble of ML model like Voting Classifier and Stacking Classifier  for analysis the dataset, in which may get 99% of accuracy or above,
With the above As an extension we can build the front end using flask framework for user testing with authentication.
